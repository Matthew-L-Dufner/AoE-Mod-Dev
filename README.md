Due to the copyright and trademark nature of most content only the coding aspect is available to the public. Private requests for content with a watermark for view by potential employers can be made available upon request. Also, GitHub claims this is C++ and while some of it is in C++ a lot of it uses EnforceScript which is similar to JavaScript and Typescript but is specifically for the game DayZ. Proper attribution is also attributed to team members S4MT3K, BAKEDJESUS, and Chappie where they contributed in some portion to the code.
